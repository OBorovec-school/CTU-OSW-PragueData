\section{Introduction}

Modern cities are collecting a lot of data to fulfil their majors' promises about SmartCities. Unfortunately most of that data is still stored separately without any level of integration so it does not really server its original purpose. This work if focused on data and ontology about neighbourhood where you live and working with many interesting sources of multiple information fields. Prague - Czech capital - was selected as the best choice to start with, because there are many information sources, which can be used and mined.

Ultimate goal of this work is to design an ontology which covers interesting information about a certen location in a city as weather, parking spot status, future projects or public transportation and traffic limitation. Such information collection can server to anybody, who is looking for a new place for living as well as creating statistics about life quality.
